Developer Manual:
	Before the developers keep working on the system development, there are a few steps that are required to do. For the server-side applications, you need to install Node.js first. If it is not installed in your device, download Node.js from the main website and install. Now you can install the frameworks of Node.js. We used Express.js. Open up a command prompt and go to your working directory. And then, install Express.js using npm. We also used EJS as a template engine in order to simplify the process of project creation, so npm ejs install is needed if want to use it. However, it is up to you to use or not, or you can choose other template engine such as Jade or Pug. If you want to test your server, you can connect to the port you have set from typing "npm start" on command prompt. In the system, the server will get API data from an outside source and store it in. Whenever users asks specific data, the client will post the data to the server. And the server will send it back to the client after filtering and getting data. Then, the users will get the requested data by passing it to the front-end. This is how the system has worked and been designed. Developers should know that the API data we used here has many bugs. There is no issue using it as a JSON file and it runs perfectly on our system, however, you should be recognized that there are many data lists that are not converted to JSON format from CSV format in order to be not confused.
